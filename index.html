<h1>Bootstrap 4 vs 6</h1>
<p>Bootstrapping is fun!Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Computer, lights up! Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. You enjoyed that. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Not if I weaken first. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Besides, you look good in a dress. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Sorry, Data. Travel time to the nearest starbase? The unexpected is our normal routine. How long can two people talk about nothing? I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. They were just sucked into space. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. This should be interesting. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing?</p>
